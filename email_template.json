  "subject": "Support Common-Sense Hemp Regulation - Not Prohibition (SB6/HB6)",
  "body": "Dear Representative {repName},\n\nMy name is {userName}, and I am {userIdentity}. I urge you to support common-sense hemp regulation in SB6/HB6â€”not another attempt at prohibition.\n\nGovernor Abbott's veto of SB 3 sent a clear message: he heard and understood Texans want regulation, not a ban. The hemp industry has pushed for age restrictions for the past three sessions and supports consumer safety. However, a ban would only:\n\n- Eliminate 53,000+ Texan jobs\n- Fuel a black market of truly unregulated products\n- Eliminate $2.1B in wages and $267M in tax revenue\n- Strip responsible adults the freedom to access to the wellness products they rely on\n\nI ask that you support SB6/HB6 with provisions that:\n\n- Set age restrictions for purchases (21+)\n- Require robust testing and labeling standards\n- Mandate child-resistant packaging on consumable products\n- Establish reasonable setbacks from schools and daycares\n- Hold bad actors accountable without punishing compliant businesses\n- Respect Texans' right to choose hemp products for health and wellbeing\n\nTexans across the political spectrum support a regulated hemp market. Please listen to your voters and back balanced policies that promote safety, protect small businesses, and reflect the will of the people.\n\nSincerely,\n{userName}"
